      <p>Hello! My name is Bismarck, I am so excited to be learning HTML, I work for a company called doTERRA, I live in Lehi Utah, I love my family, my wife Sara, my sons, Bismarck Jr. & Hevel and my daughter Gretchen.</p>
      <p>I enjoy rafting, mostly easy in Provo River. I tried some much more advanced last year and we smashed ourselves against the rocks. That was so brutal. Since then, I haven't been able to raft, but I plan to go at least once this summer.</p>
